# xxxOS

Privacy and anonymity utilities for macOS.

## Overview

xxxOS provides a comprehensive suite of command-line tools for enhancing privacy on macOS systems:

- **MAC Address Spoofing**: Randomize your network interface's MAC address
- **Tor Control**: Manage Tor service and system-wide proxy settings
- **Enhanced Privacy**: DNS management, firewall control, browser data cleaning, and more
- **Ultra Privacy Mode**: One-command maximum anonymity configuration

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. macOS operating system
2. Homebrew package manager
3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
# Install Tor
brew install tor

# Install OpenSSL (usually pre-installed)
brew install openssl

# Install ProxyChains for terminal routing (required for Tor Shell)
brew install proxychains-ng

# Install wget for reliable proxy routing
brew install wget

# Optional: Install jq for better status output
brew install jq
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone or download xxxOS
cd /path/to/xxxOS

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x xxxos
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run initial setup (installs ProxyChains configuration)
./xxxos proxychains
```

## Usage

### Quick Start with xxxos

The main control script `xxxos` provides easy access to all privacy features:

```bash
# Show help
./xxxos help

# Check overall privacy status
./xxxos status

# Basic privacy mode (MAC + Tor)
./xxxos privacy on

# Ultra privacy mode (ALL features + ProxyChains)
./xxxos privacy ultra

# Check privacy status
./xxxos privacy status
```

### Individual Features

#### MAC Address Spoofing

```bash
# Change MAC address (requires sudo)
./xxxos mac
```

#### Tor Control

```bash
# Tor management
./xxxos tor start          # Start Tor service
./xxxos tor stop           # Stop Tor service
./xxxos tor status         # Check status
./xxxos tor full-on        # Start Tor + enable system proxy
./xxxos tor full-off       # Stop Tor + disable system proxy
./xxxos tor test           # Test connection
```

#### Enhanced Privacy Features

```bash
# DNS and network
./xxxos enhance dns-clear      # Clear DNS cache
./xxxos enhance dns-privacy    # Set privacy DNS (Cloudflare)
./xxxos enhance hostname       # Randomize hostname

# Browser privacy
./xxxos enhance browser-clear  # Clear browser data (with confirmation)

# System security
./xxxos enhance firewall       # Enable firewall with stealth mode
./xxxos enhance block-tracking # Block tracking domains

# All enhanced features
./xxxos enhance all           # Activate all privacy features

# ProxyChains setup
./xxxos proxychains           # Setup ProxyChains for terminal use
```

### Tor Shell Usage

After running `./xxxos privacy ultra`, you get access to a dedicated Tor shell:

```bash
# Start Tor shell (all commands route through Tor automatically)
torshell

# In Tor shell:
checkip                       # Shows Tor status {"IsTor":true}
myip                         # Shows current Tor IP
curl https://example.com     # Automatically via Tor
git clone https://...        # Automatically via Tor
wget https://...             # Automatically via Tor
exit                         # Exit Tor shell

# Individual Tor commands (from normal shell)
torcheck                     # Check Tor connection status
torcurl https://example.com  # Single curl command via Tor
```

## Privacy Modes

### Basic Privacy Mode (`./xxxos privacy on`)
1. Changes MAC address to random value
2. Starts Tor service
3. Enables system-wide SOCKS proxy
4. Tests Tor connection

### Ultra Privacy Mode (`./xxxos privacy ultra`)
Activates ALL privacy features:
1. **MAC Address Spoofing** - Random hardware address
2. **DNS Cache Clearing** - Removes DNS history
3. **Hostname Randomization** - Changes system identifier
4. **Browser Data Cleaning** - Clears history, cookies, cache (with confirmation)
5. **Firewall Activation** - Stealth mode enabled
6. **Privacy DNS** - Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
7. **Tracking Protection** - Blocks ad/tracking domains
8. **Location Services** - Disabled
9. **Tor Network** - Full anonymization
10. **ProxyChains Setup** - Terminal command routing through Tor
11. **Tor Shell** - Dedicated shell where all commands use Tor automatically

## Features Details

### Network Privacy
- **MAC Spoofing**: Cryptographically random MAC addresses
- **DNS Management**: Cache clearing and privacy-focused DNS servers
- **Hostname Randomization**: Prevents device fingerprinting
- **Firewall**: macOS firewall with stealth mode

### Browser Privacy
- Supports Safari, Chrome, and Firefox
- Clears browsing history, cookies, and cache
- Preserves saved passwords
- Requires user confirmation before deletion

### Tor Integration
- Manages Tor service via Homebrew
- Configures macOS system proxy settings
- Auto-detects Wi-Fi network interface
- SOCKS5 proxy on port 9050
- Connection testing via check.torproject.org

### Tracking Protection
- Blocks common tracking domains via hosts file
- Includes Google Analytics, Facebook, DoubleClick, etc.
- Creates automatic backups before modification

### ProxyChains Integration
- Configures ProxyChains for reliable Tor routing
- Handles macOS-specific networking limitations
- Provides wrapper scripts for seamless command-line usage
- Includes dedicated Tor shell with automatic routing

### Tor Shell Features
- **Automatic Routing**: All network commands (`curl`, `git`, `wget`, etc.) automatically use Tor
- **Visual Indicators**: Prompt shows `ðŸ§…[TOR]` to indicate Tor mode
- **Built-in Commands**: `checkip` for connection testing, `myip` for IP display
- **Session Management**: Clean entry/exit with session preservation
- **Command Compatibility**: Works with standard tools without syntax changes

## Technical Details

- **MAC Spoofing**: Uses OpenSSL for secure random generation, ensures unicast addresses
- **Tor Integration**: Leverages macOS `networksetup` for system-wide proxy configuration
- **Network Interface**: Defaults to `en0` (Wi-Fi), auto-detection for Tor proxy
- **ProxyChains Configuration**: Custom config optimized for Tor routing at `/opt/homebrew/etc/proxychains.conf`
- **Tor Shell Implementation**: Uses PATH manipulation with wrapper scripts in `/tmp/tor_wrappers/`
- **Command Routing**: `curl` requests routed through `wget` for reliable proxy support

## Security Recommendations

For maximum anonymity:
1. Use **Tor Browser** instead of regular browsers
2. Disable **WebRTC** in your browser (prevents IP leaks)
3. Disable **JavaScript** when possible
4. Consider using **Tails OS** for critical operations
5. Use the **Tor Shell** (`torshell`) for command-line operations
6. Regularly clear browser data and cookies
7. Avoid logging into personal accounts while anonymous
8. Test your anonymity with `checkip` before sensitive operations
9. Use `./xxxos status` to verify all privacy features are active

## Limitations

- System proxy settings affect Safari and system apps, but not all applications
- Some command-line tools may bypass ProxyChains (use Tor Shell for reliable routing)
- MAC address changes are temporary and reset on reboot
- Some websites may block Tor exit nodes
- Browser fingerprinting can still identify you (use Tor Browser)
- WebRTC can leak your real IP (must be disabled manually)
- Browser data clearing requires manual confirmation for safety

## Known Issues

- `curl` on macOS may bypass ProxyChains in some configurations
- **Solution**: Use the Tor Shell (`torshell`) for guaranteed Tor routing
- Tor Shell uses `wget` as backend for reliable proxy routing
- Browser data clearing requires manual confirmation for safety (prevents accidental data loss)

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- Tor (via Homebrew)
- ProxyChains-NG (via Homebrew) 
- wget (via Homebrew)
- OpenSSL (usually pre-installed)

**Optional:**
- jq (for better JSON output formatting)

**System Requirements:**
- macOS (tested on Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Homebrew package manager
- Administrator privileges (for MAC spoofing and system configuration)
